   <p>I’m writing this review based on a few days of usage. Though I’m a bit late in buying the product by completely satisfied with the service of Vivo Rajasthan. Things that I liked most in the phone are:
    - Bigger screen, smooth touch and quick response
    - The pop up camera is an innovative mechanism and 32MP has clarity in it. Different modes in the camera are good.
    - Fast charging is really awesome and I’m mentioning it after testing. For charging from 5-100% it took 40mins.
    - Performance is also fast. Well, I’m not a gamer so no review for that.</p>
